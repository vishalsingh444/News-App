# News-App

The News App is an Android application developed using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It provides users with access to the latest news articles from various sources. The app follows the MVVM architecture pattern and incorporates Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, Retrofit for network requests, and NewsAPI.org as the data source. Additionally, the app implements pagination to efficiently load news articles.

## Features
- Top Headlines: Users can view the top news articles from different categories, such as general, business, technology, sports, etc. The articles are displayed in a paginated list, allowing smooth scrolling.

- Search Articles: Users can search for specific news articles using keywords. The app fetches relevant articles based on the search query and presents them in a paginated list.

- Save Articles: Users can save articles to read later. The saved articles are stored locally and can be accessed from the "Save" screen.
